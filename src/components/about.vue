                  <p>
                   I'm a Frontend web developer based in Nigeria, working with different web technologies to build projects i find intresting and having direct impact on people, while following best practices applicable. I'm capable of learning and working with new technologies swiftly.

                  <p>
                     Most of my time is spent on learning new technologies in the web to build awesome stuffs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Outside being a techy, I hangout with few friends and try not to be an introvert in reality while being social on social media, 😊.
